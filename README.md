# **__Welcome!__**

> I am a 13 year old amateur programmer that just likes to write code! I haven't created anything big (yet), so don't expect much on my profile. Aside from developing, I also like to cook food! [If you want to join my Discord server, click me!](https://spruce.gq/discord) This is a general chatting server, so don't expect me to talk about coding (though occasionally I will).

# **__Some things I would like to learn in the future:__**
  - TensorFlow
  - GPT
